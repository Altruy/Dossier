# Dossier

### Dossier is an application for collaboration. where you can make collaborations, add members, share notes, tasks, events, and chat.
 Main functionalities included:
- Allowing users to maintain a Dossier account using their email address for creating an
account and changing their password etc.
- Manage Collaborations
  - Each user will be able to create a fixed number of collaborations which the user
  can then only leave but not delete. The collaboration will be deleted automatically
  upon absence of active users and sufficient warning, or general consensus of all
  the users in the collaboration.
- Sharing data
  - Notes are the primary form of collaboration. Our users will be able to share their
    data in the form of text documents. The users will have the freedom to choose
    whether every user will be able to see/edit the document or only one specific user.
- Synchronise routine
  - Calendar. Each collaboration will have a common calendar shared with all the
  users within the collaboration, which each user will be able to edit in order to add
  their daily routine on a weekly basis. Users will then be able to see the free time
  (or busy times) of their co-collaborators.
- Synchronise progress
  - Users will be able to add tasks along with deadlines and reminders and add the
  intended target users from within the collaboration. Each user will have a task tab
  where all the tasks for them will be displayed and they will be able to complete or
  resolve them. Users will also be able to set when they want to be reminded about
  their deadlines.
- Communicate with other users
  - Users will be able to chat using text messages with individuals within the
  collaboration and in the group chat. The group chat will be limited to one per
  collaboration in which each user will be able to send and receive messages.
- Notifying the users
  - The Application will notify the user of their tasks, deadlines, get notifications for
  messages received, updates of the userâ€™s choosing.
